# Personal Expenses Tracker

A personal expenses tracker made using flutter toolkit and dart language.

To run the app clone the repo to your local device. Make sure you have flutter properly installed and configured. Run any emulator from Android Studio or IOS emulators from XCode. Or connect your real device and enable USB debugging in developer options of your phone. Then use the command

flutter run --no-sound-null-safety

The no sound null safety decorator is just because of a dependency that we use. So, nothing to worry about it.
